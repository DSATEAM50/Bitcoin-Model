The project Consists of 3 files namely:     
    main.c      ==>contains code for the main user interface for giving input to the code.
    Bitcoin.c   ==>Function implmentation file of our project, contains all functions we needed for the project.
    Bitcoin.h   ==>Header file, includes basic structure & functions definations
It's a basic model that impements the Bitcoin model using data structures Linked Lists, AVL Trees.
   //COMPILATION INSTRUCTION : run the command gcc Bitcoin.c main.c

# BASIC INFO : HOW TO RUN TEST CASES:

1. ENTER THE FUNCTION TO BE PERFORMED FROM THE GIVEN LIST OF FUNCTIONS AS INPUT STRINGS ON THE TERMINAL:

        1->ADDUSER                  ->ADDS A NEW USER TO THE DATABASE   
        2->TRANSACT                 ->TO TRANSACT AMONGST THE USERS
        3->ATTACK                   ->TO ATTACK THE BLOCK CHAIN, ALTER IT'S NONCE
        4->VALIDATE                 ->CHECKS WHETHER THE BLOCK CHAIN STRUCTURE IS VALID OR NOT==>IF NOT IT FIXES THE BLOCK CHAIN STRUCTURE
        5->PRINTUSERDETAILS         ->TO PRINT DETAILS FOR THE USER(WALLET BALANCE,UID,AND JOINING DATE)
        6->PRINTUSERTRANSACTIONS    ->TO PRINT TRANSACTION HISTORY OF A PARTICULAR USER    
        7->EXIT                     ->TERMINATES THE PROGRAM

2. FOLLOWING QUERIES CAN BE PERFORMED:

        A.)ADDUSER->GENERATES A RANDOM UID, VALIDATES IF THAT UID DOESNT EXISTS ALREADY IN THE USER SYSTEM IF NOT THEN IT ADDS USER WITH THAT UNIQUE UID 
                    AND A 1000 COIN JOINING BONUS

                INPUT INSTRUCTION:INPUT THE STRING "ADDUSER" TO ADDING A NEW USER TO THE USER DATABASE

                OUTPUT:PRINTS RANDOM UID OF THE USER GENERATED AND JOINING BONUS BALANCE OF THE USER 

        B.)TRANSACT->TRANSACTS AMONGST THE USERS

                INPUT INSTRUCTIONS:INPUT THE STRING "TRANSACT" FOR CARRYING A TRANSACTION
                    THEN ENTER INPUT AS : <RECIEVER's Id> <SENDER's Id> <TRANSACTION AMOUNT>
                    
                OUTPUT:
                    1.)INVALID TRANSACTION==>IF AMOUNT<=0
                    2.)INVALID USER ID if==> EITHER OF SENDER OR RECIEVER UID IS'NT VALID//NOT PRESENT IN THE SYSYTEM DATABASE
                    3.)INSUFFICIENT BALANCE==>IF SENDERS'S WALLET BALANCE <=TRANSACTION AMOUNT
                    4.)PRINTS SENDER'S & RECIEVER'S BALANCE BEFORE TRANSACTION AND PRINTS SENDER'S & RECIEVER'S BALANCE AFTER TRANSACTION 

        C.)ATTACK->TO ATTACK A BLOCK IN THE BLOCK CHAIN AND ALTER IT'S NONCE
                INPUT INSTRUCTION:INPUT THE STRING "ATTACK" FOR GENERATING AN ATTACK ON THE CURRENT BLOCK CHAIN STRUCTURE

                OUTPUT:
                    1.)ATTACK SUCCESSFUL ==> IF A VALID ATTACK AND NONCE OF A BLOCK IN THE CHAIN CHANGED
                    2.)ATTACK FAILED ==> IF COULDN'T CHANGE THE NONCE OF A BLOCK

        D.)VALIDATE->CHECKS WHETHER THE BLOCK CHAIN STRUCTURE IS VALID OR NOT==>IF NOT IT FIXES THE BLOCK CHAIN STRUCTURE
                INPUT INSTRUCTION:INPUT THE STRING "VALIDATE" FOR CHECKING THE VALIDITY OF THE CURRENT BLOCK CHAIN STRUCTURE

                OUTPUT:
                    1.)BLOCKCHAIN IS VALID==> IF BLOCK CHAIN IS FOUND TO BE VALID
                    2.) <WHEN BLOCKCHAIN ISNT VALID>
                        a.)ATTACK DETECTED!!==>FLAG MESSAGE
                            <OUTPUTS:THE WRONG NONCE AND HASH OF THE BLOCK>
                             ATTACK FIXED!!==>FLAG MESSAGE
                              <OUTPUTS:THE CORRECT NONCE AND HASH OF THE BLOCK>
                           <AT THE END OUTPUTS THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS DETECTED AND FIXED!!!>

        E.)PRINTUSERDETAILS->TO PRINT DETAILS FOR THE USER(WALLET BALANCE,UID,AND JOINING DATE)
                INPUT INSTRUCTION:INPUT THE STRING "PRINTUSERDETAILS" FOR PRINTING THE DETAILS OF A PARTICULAR USER UID
                     THEN ENTER INPUT AS : <INPUT USER UID>
        
                OUTPUT:
                    1.)INVALID USER ==> IF NO USER WITH ENTERED UID EXISTS IN THE DATABASE
                    2.)<USER ID><WALLET BALANCE><USER SINCE:DATE/TIME OF JOINING> ==> IF USER WITH ENTERED UID EXISTS

        F.)PRINTUSERTRANSACTIONS->TO PRINT TRANSACTION HISTORY OF A PARTICULAR USER 
                INPUT INSTRUCTION:INPUT THE STRING "PRINTUSERTRANSACTIONS" FOR PRINTING THE DETAILS OF A PARTICULAR USER UID
                     THEN ENTER INPUT AS : <INPUT USER UID>
        
                OUTPUT:
                    1.)INVALID USER ==> IF NO USER WITH ENTERED UID EXISTS IN THE DATABASE
                    2.)TRANSACTION LIST EMPTY-NO TRANSACTION TO SHOW!!==>IF USER EXISTS BUT NO TRANSACTION HAS BEEN MADE
                    3.)TRANSACTIONS MADE BY  USER <USERID>        ==>FOR EACH OF THE TRANSACTION MADE BY THE USER WITH ENTERED UID 
                      <TO>      <FROM>      <AMOUNT>        <TRANSACTION DATE/TIME> 
                                 <transaction details>

        G.)EXIT->TERMINATES THE PROGRAM
                INPUT INSTRUCTION:INPUT THE STRING "EXIT" 

                 OUTPUT:PROGRAM-TERMINATED
